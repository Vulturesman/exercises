Basic printing
Create a new .php file in your today's exercise folder.
At the top of the file start and end PHP code with opening and closing PHP tags.
Right after the closing PHP tag put HTML code for a basic HTML 5 page.
In the PHP code part, copy-paste this code:
$title = 'Inline PHP practice';
Use php echo (or the short PHP echo tag) to print the value of the variable $title into the HTML markup in 2 places:
As the inner HTML the <title> element: <title>Inline PHP practice</title>
Create a new <h1> element in the body and print it also as the inner HTML of it: <h1>Inline PHP practice</h1> -->
